Glossary and notes
Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

Vocabulary:

Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”
Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter
purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.
quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”
stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”
Passage to analyze
Hyginus, chapter 30, sections 7-9.


7 Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die *purgavit*, 
maiorem partem 
> Iove adiutore; 
> flumine admisso 
totum stercus *abluit*.
 
In one day, Hercules cleaned up the manure and stable of King Augeas, Jupitor helping him for the most part;
Because the river had been let in, he cleaned away all of the dung. 

8 taurum 
> cum quo Pasiphae *concubuit* 
ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum *adduxit*.

Hercules led the bull with whom Pasiphae laid with alive from the island of Crete to Mycenae.

9 Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, 
> qui carne humana *vescebantur*, 
cum Abdero famulo *interfecit*; 
equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.

He killed Diomedes, king of Thrace, and his four horses who used to eat human flesh, along with Abderus his slave. The names of the horses were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus.  

A. Grammatical analysis
Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

B. Grammatical questions
In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase? This is in the ablative case because the noun Jupiter doesnt appear anywhere else in this sentence.

What case is stercus, and why is it in that case? accusative- bobile is also accusative. It is in this case because it is the direct object in the statement.

Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree). accusative, singular, feminine, comparative degree (bigger) 

Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso. Admisso is the fourth principle part. This is in the ablative case 

What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui? nominative masculine singular 

What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus? nomina, which is imperative

C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

1) *Iove adiutore* enhances the meaning of the passage because it is written in the ablative case. This sticks out in the sentence and gives it a different meaning.
2) *qui carne humana vescebantur* is a clause in this passage that also stuck out to me because it enhances the meaning of this part of the story by adding more specific details.
