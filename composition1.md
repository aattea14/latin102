Heracles travelled to the city of Oechalia in Aetolia, and asked the king, Eurytus, for permission to marry his daughter, Iole. When Eurytus refused, Heracles not only destroyed the city, but killed Iole’s parents before her very eyes. He then took Iole captive, and sent her to his home, to his wife Deianira (!)

Your first sentence should use a temporal clause to express that when Hercules came to Oechalia, he asked to marry Iole.
imperfect indicative (second half of sentence), venio 

Your second sentence should state that when her father Eurytus was unwilling, Hercules captured Oechalia.
indicative perfect inactive (second half of sentence) 
capture- capio
unwilling- nolo

Your third sentence should express that Hercules said that he would kill her parents, and should include an indirect statement.
said= perfect, 
verb of indirect statement needs to be in infinitive 
subject of infinitive in accusative case 

Your fourth sentence should say that Iole endured that her parents were killed.
Iole endured- independent clause

Your fifth statement should say that when he had killed all of them, he sent Iole to Deianira.
