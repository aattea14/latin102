This passage explains how Hercules killed Diomedes, his four flesh eating horses, and his slave. One difference is that this piece of art only depicts 3 horses, when the passage of Hyginus names four horses that Hercules killed. However, the rest of the art is very similar to the passage; it shows Hercules slaying Diomedes and feeding his human flesh to the horses, along with the slave that Hercules also kills.
