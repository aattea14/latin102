when deianira saw
    that Iole had been brought
she began to devise a plot
    in order not to lose her husband 


  
temporal clause (cum- indicative for time? subjunct circumstance?)-- 
      Iolen adductam esse (indirect statement = infinitive + subject accusative)
Coepiebat/coepit machinari

2) Deianiram❌ famulum misit ❌ferre Hercules vestimentum summersit in centaurum Nessum sanguinem, quid cogitavit potioni amori. **We need a *purpose* construction here:  unlike English, Latin can't express that with an infinitive "to do something".**
qui with relative clause, or gerunduve with "a" = in order to (purpose)
she thought that = thinking introduces an indirect statement-- need accusative subject and infinitive "to be" ESSE
QUI FERRIT= in order to bring it 

Famulum misit ad vestem ferendam Hercules summersit

5) Dicitur❌ (CHANGED) Hercules ortus est ad immortalem ❌**Need indirect statement**, sed Deianira se occidit❌ **What mood is this?** (CHANGED) ob haec. 
dicitur= it is said 


gerundive: ad and noun it agrees with is a passive verbal idea 

ad vestem ferendam= garment should be brought back 

Famulum misit ad vestem ferendam= she sent her slave in order to bring back garment
