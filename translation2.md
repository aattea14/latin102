In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

Deianira, wife of Hercules, could not cross the large river, which was named Evenus, and the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubis, asked for help. This taking away of Deianira in the river he wished to violate her himself. When Hercules came to this place and Deianira believed he would help, Nessus pierced him with his arrow. As he was dying, when he knew the arrows were soaked in great potency of the poisonous liquid Hydra Lerna, he gave his blood to Deianira and he said it was a love potion.
