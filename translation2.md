William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin. 
moriens 

Deianira, wife of Hercules, could not cross the large river, which was named Evenus, and she asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubis, for help. When she had been carried into the river, he wanted to violate her. When Hercules interferred and Deianira had begged for his help, Hercules pierced Nessus with his arrows. As he was dying, when he knew the arrows had great power because they had been soaked in the poisonous liquid of the Hydra Lerna, he gave his blood after it had been removed to Deianira and he said it was a love potion.
